# Changelog

## [0.0.2] – 2026-05-01

Compatibility release: Markdown Preview now runs on macOS 15 Sequoia in addition to macOS 26 Tahoe.

- **Lowered the minimum macOS version to 15.0 (Sequoia).** Previously required macOS 26 Tahoe.
- **Replaced the app icon with an Icon Composer `.icon` bundle.** Fixes the icon appearing oversized on Sequoia — the system now applies its own mask and the standard safe-area inset.

## [0.0.1] – 2026-04-30

First public build of Markdown Preview — a fast, native macOS reader for `.md` files.

### Highlights

- Native WKWebView rendering with heading anchors and external link handling
- Sidebar table of contents that mirrors document headings (click to jump)
- Toggleable inspector panel with file metadata
- In-document search via the toolbar field plus standard `⌘F` / `⌘G` / `⌘⇧G`
- Open With menu that filters to apps declaring an editor role for Markdown and remembers your pick
- Share menu that copies the Markdown source itself, so Copy / Mail / Notes / Messages get the content instead of a file URL
- Quick Look extension for system-wide `.md` previews from Finder, Spotlight, and Mail
- Offer to register as the default `.md` handler on first launch
- Supports `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdown`, and `.txt`
